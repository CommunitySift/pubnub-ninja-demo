# pubnub-ninja-demo
A simple demo app showing how to get Sift Ninja working with PubNub Blocks

# Getting Started
Before we can get our chat app going, we'll need to have accounts set up with both PubNub and Sift Ninja.
 
## PubNub
* Sign up for a free account at [www.pubnub.com](https://www.pubnub.com)
* Once your account is created, create a new App called "Sift Ninja Demo" 
from your main account page, and select the app's card
* You'll be taken to a page showing the keysets (pairs of API keys to both Publish and Subscribe to an app's channels)
for your app. A keyset called **Demo Keyset** will have already been created, so we'll use that. Make note of the keys; we'll need them later.
* Turn on support for Blocks by selecting **Demo Keyset** and then switching the **PubNub Blocks** setting to *On* and selecting **Save Changes**.
* Now that your app is set up, we can import the Sift Ninja Block.

## Import the Block
* Visit the Sift Ninja Block page at [www.pubnub.com/blocks-catalog/sift-ninja](https://www.pubnub.com/blocks-catalog/sift-ninja/)
* Select "Try it Now" to create a new Block and import the Sift Ninja template
* For a brand new PubNub account, you can accept the default values and select **Get Started**
